This is some emojis meant for use in C programs for the TI-84 Plus CE however these are pngs so they can be used pretty much anywhere. They are designed to be small to save space while still keeping the look we all know and love. These emojis are 13x13 if there is an emoji you want me to make within reason plese make an issue detailing the full name of the emoji for instance ```eyes``` and the emoji itself or a link to a picture of the emoji.
